### Building and running the docker container

When you're ready, start townyAI-mineflayer by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

this will attempt to connect to any server running on localhost:25565. you can change the IP and port in the `compose.yaml` file.

you can also find automated builds on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sheepy3/townyai-mineflayer).
